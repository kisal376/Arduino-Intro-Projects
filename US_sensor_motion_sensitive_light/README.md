# Motion detection using Ultrasonic sensor

- The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance to an object.
- If a change in distance greater than 1 cm is detected, the LED gradually turns on to full brightness and stays on for 30 seconds.
- After 30 seconds, or if no significant change in distance is detected, the LED gradually dims back off.
