# Motion and light dependent LED using Ultasonic sensor

- Continuously monitors both environmental light and the distance to an object (e.g., a person).
- If the environment is dark and the distance to an object changes beyond the set tolerance, the LED is triggered to gradually turn on.
- The LED stays on for a defined time before automatically dimming back off unless the distance or darkness conditions continue to be met.
